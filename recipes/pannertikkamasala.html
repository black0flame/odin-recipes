    Now that tomatoes are in season, I want to cook with them all the time. They have robust flavor and add a lovely hue to your dishes. One of my favorite things to cook with tomatoes is chicken tikka masala. “Tikka” in Indian cuisine refers to pieces of meat or vegetables marinated in spices. “Masala” refers to blends of spices in paste or powder form. Chicken tikka masala, then, is a dish of cooked marinated chicken pieces that’s bathed in a rich tomato sauce.

   <p> In this recipe, I make a vegetarian version using paneer instead of chicken. Although I use a number of spices in this paneer tikka masala recipe, it is simple to cook. The paneer has a lovely flavorful crust on the outside, and it pair so well with the masala sauce.
